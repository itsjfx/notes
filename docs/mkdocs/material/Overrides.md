# Overrides

Similar to [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima#customizing-templates), you can do overrides for `mkdocs-material`:

https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/

Overrides setup here:
* https://github.com/itsjfx/notes/tree/master/overrides
* https://github.com/itsjfx/notes/blob/master/overrides/partials/actions.html#L3
    * To change the view button on pages to show the `/blob/` page instead of the `/raw/` page on GitHub
