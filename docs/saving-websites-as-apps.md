# Saving websites as applications on Linux

I wanted to save the [Steam Chat](https://steamcommunity.com/chat) as a app. Easy to do in Chrome:
* Menu -> More tools -> Create shortcut
* It'll create an `.application` file in `~/.local/share/applications/` with the `favicon` saved -- meaning it'll be automatically picked up by Rofi :D
